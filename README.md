# StackRpg

## Concept
To challenge your dungeoneer enough to reap enough experience and loot without challenging them so much they die.

## How to play
You create templates of up to 5 monsters and then throw these monster into conflict with your hero. 
They will fight to the death and you are only allowed minial intervention (heals and one of special abilities)
When monsters die you gain experience, states and loot to make you stronger for the next encounter.

## Current Status
This is a very early alpha.

Once in Beta, I will deploy it online for people to play.
